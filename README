This repository contains a `docker` image which contains a bunch of
formal method tools, packaged conveniently together.

To build the image use:

    ./build

Once the image is built, you can run solvers using:

    ./run SOLVER OPTIONS

To just start a shell in the `docker` image use:

    ./run

Currently we install the following solvers:
  * Z3        4.8.8
  * Yices     2.6.2
  * CVC4      1.8
  * abc       (github master)
  * Boolector 3.2.1
  * OpenSMT   (github master)
  * Sally     (master)
